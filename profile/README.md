# RocketsAreNostalgic [RAN]

RAN is the home of a small collection of WordPress plugins that [I've](https://github.com/bnjmnrsh) created over the years. Designed before [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) , many of them add features to the TinyMCE toolbar and so can be used in any WordPress install that uses the [Classic Editor Plugin](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/).

These plugins are currently used in production on several websites and receive minor updates from time to time. I welcome bug reports and PRs; however, at this time, I cannot offer much direct support. 

Publishing these projects is an aspirational first step toward full Gutenberg support –– watch this space.
